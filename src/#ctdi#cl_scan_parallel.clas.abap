*"* Parallel worker for the control-character scan (batched-wave model).
*"* The DRIVER reads one package of rows and ships it here as an XSTRING
*"* packet; this worker (running in a separate work process via
*"* CL_ABAP_PARALLEL->RUN) deserializes the rows, SCANS them with
*"* /CTDI/CL_CNTRL_SCANNER, and ships the hits back as XSTRING. The worker
*"* does NOT read the database - reading stays in the driver so there is no
*"* key partitioning and no per-worker DB cursor.
